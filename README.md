# Argus - Simulation of self-guided missile using computer vision 

The goal of this project is to create a realistic simulation with 




## Vizion Model

- Dataset kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/a2015003713/militaryaircraftdetectiondataset
All type of planes in 1 class : Plane to make a 1 class model and get more accuracy
- GPU Kaggle - 10 min - GPU P100
- Yolov8 (spec yolo)


## Simulation

For the simulation I used the Game Engine Unity 2023

### 3d assets on sketch fab

### Use yolo model in unity

To use a yolo model in unity. I used a packed named (Sentis)[]. 
I export the model in onxx 

### Physics implementation


#### self-guidance

## Why argus ?
I choose the name of Argus for this project because its a reference to the mythologie était le géant doté de cent yeux 

## Improvements

-For the future i can image an hybride model to combine detection and tracking
-better physics 
-better ui and camera features
